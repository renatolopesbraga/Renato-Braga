### Hi I'm Renato 🖖

Somethings about me 👌

I have a background in Computer Science 🖥️ and a postgraduate degree in Business Management, with a strong focus on analytics and data science. Throughout my career, I gained experience working within companies, where I played a key role in data analysis for strategic decision making, creating indicators through business intelligence.💡

I have used a wide variety of tools including 🐍 Python, SQL, Tableau, Looker Studio (Data Studio), Power BI, HTML, CSS, Excel and Google Sheets, . Currently, I am improving my knowledge in data science, aiming to interpret and use data effectively to help companies achieve their goals and solve business problems efficiently.
